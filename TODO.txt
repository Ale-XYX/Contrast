TODO:

- Rework wrapping to look more noticable
	- Make it color specific? 
	- Generate Gradient on the fly?

- Make the colors coherent
	- Switch all colors to public.[COLOR] instead of having an odd mix of ints and vars

- Add all the levels. ALL. OF. THEM.

- Redo README with new screenshots and a more Time-Proof approach to images. 
	- ?? Possibly make the entire README an image ??

- Add error handling once every aspect of the game is totally complete.

- COMPLETE THIS ALL BEFORE PYWEEK 27. [Or not, just trying to encourage myself :^)]
