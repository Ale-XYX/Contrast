Wrapping Up TODO:

	- ?? Possibly make the entire README an image ??

- Move credits to end once all levels are finished.

- Add error handling once every aspect of the game is totally complete.

- Add documentation to more complex pieces of code

- Try to remove redundancy and increase coherency

- Lint it when you're done to remove any final improper bits

- Freeze it and add it to a GitHub release.
