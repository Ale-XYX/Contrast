# Contrast

**A Pyweek 25 Game by TEAM-ABSTRACTANDROID**

In contrast, you play as `0x`, a lone creature in a monochrome, industrial world.

While traversing through the game, you have the power to "Flip" the background, making some objects interactable, and some uninteractable.

For example, a White Block in a black background would be interactable, but a black block in a black background would be uninteractable, and vice versa.

This is all to collect the elusive *RGB Sphere*, the only color in the melancholy world.

Work your way through 15 puzzling levels, using the mechanics and obstacles to obtain the RGB sphere and bring color to this world.
